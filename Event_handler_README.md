
# PLAN OF ACTION

# A collaborative Event handler for college societies.

## Expected Timeline : (7th May - 7th May)

## Summary  :
A web-application that serves as a platform for college societies to post about their events. The application will include the ability for users to create, read, update, and delete content (CRUD). Users will need to create an account to upload content, and other students will be able to comment and ask questions on the posts. Overall, the goal is to provide a centralized platform for different college societies to promote their events and engage with their fellow students. 

## Prerequisite : Git and Github
## Step 1 : Structure Design : 
Define the features and functionalities we want in our porject.
Such as its visual representation,color schema,user friendy,etc.

**To design our page we can use these free softwares :**
 Figma or Adobe XD

## Step 2 : Front-End :
To get the Basic skeleton of our webiste correct, we need to Choosing a front-end framework, such as React or Vue, and develop the user interface. Implement the design and layout, and ensure that the web application is responsive and accessible.

**IMPORTANT THINGS TO IMPLEMENT :** 

* Implementing user authentication and authorization on the front-end, ensuring that users have to log in before they can upload any content.
* Developing the front-end functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts, comments, and user accounts. Implement form validation to ensure that users enter valid data.

**Tech Stack :**

**1) Front-End :** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**2) Framework :** React(recommended), Vue 

## Step 3 : Back-End : 
Integrate the front-end with the back-end of the web application, using API calls to send and receive data.

**IMPORTANT THINGS TO IMPLEMENT**
* Implement user authentication and authorization on the back-end, ensuring that users have to log in before they can upload any content.

* Develop the back-end functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts, comments, and user accounts. 

* Implement API endpoints for sending and receiving data between the front-end and the back-end of the web application.

**Tech Stack :**
Node.js(recommended), Django, or Ruby on Rails.

## step 4 : DataBase : 
**MongoDB, MySql**

## Step 5 : Testing and Optimizing(if possible) : 
* Test the back-end for bugs and errors, and fix any issues that arise.
* Optimize the back-end for performance (if possible).

## Step 6 : Deploy and Maintain : 
Deploy the Website and maintain it if any issue arises.

**Deployment platform  :**
Hiroku, Github Pages, Netlify, AWS , etc (This part will be discussed once this project reaches certain complition).
